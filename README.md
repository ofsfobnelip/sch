## Assignment
1. Checking saddle point of Matrx MxM.
Saddle point is where value is **min** in **rows** and **max** in **columns**.
[Here](./SaddlePoint.java)
2. Checking for a Wonderous Square. The **sum** of all the *rows* and *columns* is **same**.
[Here](./WonderSquare.java)
3. Calulating MOBIUS of a number. ***i.e.***
   * If **1** then **1**
   * **0** if a prime factor comes  **more than once**
   * **(-1)<sup>p</sup>** is there are **p distinct prime factors**.<br>
[Here](./MOBIUS.java)
4. Printing the **Consecutive** Numbers whose sum adds upto the number entered. ***Like***
    * 9 = 4+5, 2+3+4
    * 27 = 2+3+4+5+6+7, 8+9+10, 13+14.<br>
[Here](./ConsecSum.java)
5. A Wonderous Square is a n by n matrix.
    * It contains Integers from 1 to n<sup>2</sup>,where each integer appears only once.
    * The sum of integers in any row or column should add upto in any row or column should add upto
    **0.5*n(n<sup>2</sup>+1)**<br>
[Here](./WonderSquare1.java)
6. A Smith number is a number in which the sum of digits of a number is equal to sum digits of
the prime factors(excluding 1) of that number.
[Here](./Smith.java)
7. A Adam-Prime number is a number in which is both Adam and Prime Number. Adam Number is number 
in which square of a number and the sqaure of its reverse are reverse to each other.
[Here](./Smith.java)
8. A Kaprekar number is a number in which the sqaure of the number is split into two parts 
and the sum of those two parts is equal to number. For e.x- 45<sup>2</sup>=2025 -> 20 + 45 == 45, 
297<sup>2</sup>=88209 -> 88 + 209 == 297.
[Here](./Kaprekar.java)
9. An Evil Number is a number in which it's binary equivalent contains even times of 1's occurences.
[Here](./Evil.java)
10. A Reversible Prime is a number which is prime and its reverse is also a prime.
Both the integers consits of 3 or 9 at thier either ends.
[Here](./RevPrime.java)
11. In a unique number every digit is distict. Enter a range of **m** to **n** and search for unique 
numbers.
[Here](./Unique.java)
## Methods
1. Implementing Selection Sort, for descending order.
[Here](./SelectSort.java)
2. Implement a BubbleSort to Ascending order.Initialize Array of A and B of ***M*** and ***N***. Sort it Join the Elements Consecutively.
[Here](./BubbleSort.java)
3. Write a program to implement Matric Multiplication.
[Here](./MatrixMul.java)
## Arrays ISC
1. Number Freequency Counter in an Array.
[Here](./NumFreq.java)
2. Write a program to accept a set of n integers (where n > 0) in a single dimensional array. Arrange the elements of the array such that the lowest number appears in the centre of the array, next lower number in the right cell of the centre, next lower in the left cell of the centre and so on. The process will stop when the highest number will set in its appropriate cell. Finally, display the array elements. Assume that the memory space is less. Hence, you don't need to create extra array for the aforesaid task.
[Here](./CentInt.java) and also [Here](./CentInt1.java)
